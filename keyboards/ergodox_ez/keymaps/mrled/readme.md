# mrled's keyboard layout

The ErgoDox EZ I have has really helped with RSI -
so much that I asked work to buy me one too.

## Useful keys for multi function use

Some keys are particularly suited to tap/doubletap/hold/etc multi function use.

    KEY NAME,NORMALLY USED,NORMALLY UNUSED
    space,tap|doubletap,hold
    semicolon,tap,doubletap|hold
    a-z0-9,tap|doubletap,hold
    dash,tap|doubletap,hold
    equals,tap|doubletap,hold
    tab,tap|doubletap,hold
    escape,tap|doubletap,hold
    comma,tap,doubletap|hold
    period,tap|doubletap,hold

Currently incomplete, just wanted to start this as it will help when developing other layouts -
especially restricted layouts like the gergodox.

(Ultimately maybe can include commands for isolating keys with certain features from that list above?)

## Musings and future experiments

* Single ctrl in R of L tcluster actually hurts with L handed chords :(...
  it didn't at first but after a whole day of excited typing it did
* Bottom-mid 1.5u key currently has R/LGUI; consider ctrl/alt there?
* Leader key on upper L 1u of R side currently KC_LEAD -
  maybe should use this key for something I need more often,
  since it's easy to hit,
  and leader key things will have my hands probably going everywhere.
  I use it more for uncommon things like capslock rather than things I use all the time.

## To do / wishlist

* Flash lights on success/failure of leader key combos
* Allow turning off the keyboard backlight
* Actually, base layer with no locks or temporary states maybe shouldn't use backlight,
  or should make it dimmer.
  (Also just get a desk pad at home so it doesn't reflect)
* Probably should experiment with combos -
  maybe the most ergonomic way to do some things?
  Maybe experiment with my gergoplex layout as an intro to this topic.
